                <p>In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules to convert information—such
                    as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for
                    communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example is an
                    invention of language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they thought,
                    saw, heard, or felt to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice
                    can carry and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered. The invention of
                    writing, which converted spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication
                    across space and time.

                    The process of encoding converts information from a source into symbols for communication or
                    storage. Decoding is the reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the
                    recipient understands, such as English or/and Spanish.

                    One reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain language, spoken or
                    written, is difficult or impossible. For example, semaphore, where the configuration of flags held
                    by a signaler or the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically individual
                    letters, and numbers. Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and
                    reproduce the words sent.</p>
